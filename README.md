## Finland

Finland uses a 11 digit number for the Personal Identity Code with the format `DDMMYYCZZZQ`.

Explaining the format by each section:
* `DDMMYY` represents the date of birth
* `C` represents the century (`+` for people born in 1800-1899, `-` for people born in 1900-1999, and `A` for people born in 2000-2099)
* `ZZZ` is the personal identification number (odd for males and even for females)
* `Q` is a checksum character
