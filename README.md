Create a new Laravel project:

```bash
composer create-project â€” prefer-dist laravel/laravel package-tester
```

Create `packages/reducktion` folders in the root of the project:

![alt text](docs/folder_structure.png "Directory Structure")

Now navigate to the package directory (`packages/reducktion`) and git clone the package:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AlexOlival/socrates.git
```

All good to go! :grin:
